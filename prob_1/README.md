# Staircase Problem

You have a staircase with (n) number of steps

```
n = 4
        _
      _|4
    _|3
  _|2
_|1
0
```

## Problem 1

Write a function that can tell you how many ways there are to get up the steps using either 1 or 2 steps

### Example:

1. 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
2. 0 - 2 - 4
3. 0 - 2 - 3 - 4
4. 0 - 1 - 2 - 4
5. 0 - 1 - 3 - 4

When (n) is 4 the answer is 5

## Problem 2

Write a function that tells you have many ways to get up the steps given a set of numbers

### Example:

steps = 1, 3, 5

1. 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
2. 0 - 1 - 4
3. 0 - 3 - 4
